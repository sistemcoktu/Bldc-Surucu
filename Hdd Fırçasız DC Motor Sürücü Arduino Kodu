Brushless DC Motor Control ESC 2.0
 
This sketch cascades 6 outputs which when connected properly
 can generate a three phase square wave which can in turn run
 a brushless DC motor.
 
This circuit has advanced from my Brushless DC Motor Control
 ESC 1.0 because I have added a speed control potentiometer
 to control the motor speed.
 
I suggest that you not try to run a motor directly off of the outputs
 of the Arduino but use some transistors to handle the load.

 // We are also assigning the variables to the physical discrete pins
 // Outputs can be any outputs you want

 int led2 =  1;
 int led3 =  2;
 int led4 =  3;
 int led5 =  4;
 int led6 =  5;
 int potpin = A0;  //This is the analog input for the pot
 int gecikme;         //This is the gecikme varible for the speed
 
// The setup() method runs once, when the sketch starts
 
void setup()   {
 // initialize the digital pin as an output:
 pinMode(led1, OUTPUT);
 pinMode(led2, OUTPUT);
 pinMode(led3, OUTPUT);
 pinMode(led4, OUTPUT);
 pinMode(led5, OUTPUT);
 pinMode(led6, OUTPUT);
 pinMode(potpin, INPUT);
 }
 
// the loop() method runs over and over again,
 // as long as the Arduino has power
 /*
 LESD1, LED3, and LED5 will be positive, LED2, LED4, and LED6 are negative.
 You will notice that two LEDs are on at the same time so that one of the
 three motor coils are energised at a time.
